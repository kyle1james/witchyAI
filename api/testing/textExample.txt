Welcome to the tiny Jiji API

        This API provides access to the CrystalBall class, which can perform NLP tasks such as question answering.

        To use the CrystalBall class, you need to initialize an instance and collect sentences from a document or text.

        Here's an example usage:
        
        crystal_ball = CrystalBall()
        document = "This is a sample document containing some sentences."
        crystal_ball.collect_sentences(document)
        
        Once the sentences are collected, you can ask questions and get answers using the `answer_question()` method.
